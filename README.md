# WhatsApp Number Verification Bot

This Python script is designed to automate the process of checking WhatsApp phone numbers for their validity by sending a test message and analyzing the response. It utilizes the Selenium WebDriver to interact with WhatsApp Web. Below is a brief overview of the script and instructions for setting it up:

## Prerequisites

Before running the script, you need to make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

1. **Python**: Ensure you have Python installed on your computer. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Selenium**: You'll need to install the Selenium library using pip:
   
   ```
   pip install selenium
   ```

3. **WebDriver**: This script uses a web driver to interact with the web. You should have the appropriate web driver installed and configured. In this script, it's assumed that the web driver is set up using a separate module called `driver_module`. You can replace it with the appropriate web driver for your browser.

4. **WhatsApp Web**: You need to have WhatsApp Web opened and logged in on your default browser before running the script.

## Instructions

Follow these steps to use the script:

1. **Prepare Input Data**: Create a file named `input.txt` and populate it with the phone numbers you want to check, each on a separate line.

2. **Run the Script**: Execute the script by running it in your Python environment.

   ```
   python your_script_name.py
   ```

   Replace `your_script_name.py` with the actual filename of your script.

3. **Wait for Execution**: The script will start checking each phone number by sending a test message and waiting for a response.

4. **View Results**: The script will save the results to an `output.txt` file, indicating whether each phone number is valid or not.

## Script Explanation

- The `Bot` class is the main component of the script, responsible for the WhatsApp number verification process.

- It reads phone numbers from the `input.txt` file and checks them one by one.

- For each phone number, it sends a test message and waits for a response. The results are saved in the `output.txt` file.

- The script utilizes the Selenium WebDriver to interact with WhatsApp Web, waiting for elements to load and sending test messages.

- The status of each phone number (valid or invalid) is recorded in the `output.txt` file.

- The `start()` method is the entry point for the script. It reads the input data, opens WhatsApp Web, and initiates the verification process.

Please note that the script interacts with WhatsApp Web, and WhatsApp's web interface may change over time. Be prepared to adjust the script if WhatsApp Web's structure or behavior changes.

**Disclaimer:** Always ensure that you are complying with WhatsApp's terms of service and privacy policies when using this script. Automated messaging and scraping may violate WhatsApp's policies, and it is your responsibility to use this script responsibly and within legal bounds.
